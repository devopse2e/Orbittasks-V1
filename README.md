## 🏗 Architecture

OrbitTasks follows a clean **frontend–backend** separation with a modern React codebase.

**Frontend:**
- **React** with Hooks for stateful, functional components.
- **Context API** (`AuthContext`, `TodosContext`) for global state management.
- **React Router DOM** for page routing and protected routes.
- **CSS Custom Properties** and modular styles for light/dark theming.
- **Optimistic UI Updates** for instant interactions while syncing with backend.
- **NLP Parsing** integrated in the task creation workflow.

**Backend** (expected implementation):
- A REST API handling authentication, profile, and task CRUD operations.
- **JWT or token-based authentication** for security.
- Database persistence for registered user data.
- Guest mode support with `localStorage` fallback.

**Storage:**
- **localStorage** for caching user sessions and guest tasks.
- Backend database for permanent account storage.

**UI Architecture Highlights:**
- Modular components for reusability (`TodoItem`, `TodoForm`, `CompletedTasksPanel`, etc.).
- **Drag & Drop** support for the floating completed tasks panel.
- Fully responsive, mobile-first design.
